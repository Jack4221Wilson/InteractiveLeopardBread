        <div class='dropcontR'>

          <h3>Make the Dough:</h3>
          <ol>

            <li>Stir cornstarch in cup of warm milk until dissolved.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine milk mixture, yeast, and 2 Tbsp of the sugar. Gently stir together and let sit for 8-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Add melted butter (cooled to room temp.), the rest of the sugar, salt, vanilla and orange zest to yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Using the dough hook attachment mix on medium low speed.</li>
            <li>Slowly spoon in flour on medium speed, and then turn up to medium high until dough has formed.</li>
            <li>The dough should be very slightly tacky, with a soft and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Once formed, let the dough rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn mixer back on to medium high and beat for 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>(Tear off a small piece of dough and stretch out with your fingers. A simple “window pane” test will let you know if the dough is ready. If not, beat for another 2-3 minutes and test again.)</li>
            <li>Remove dough from bowl and place on a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Weigh your dough and divide into two halves.</li>
            <li>Lightly dust one half with flour, wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Take the second half and evenly divide it into two halves.</li>
            <li>Make Chocolate Pastes</li>
            <li>Use a separate bowl for each paste.</li>
            <li>Stir cocoa powder and milk together with a spoon.</li>
            <li>You should have one thick chocolate paste and one light chocolate paste.</li>
            <li>Place one of the remaining halves of dough in each bowl of paste.</li>
            <li>Work the chocolate into the dough with your hands. Kneading to incorporate all the chocolate into each dough.</li>
            <li>You should now have one dark chocolate ball of dough and one light chocolate ball of dough.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour each ball, cover in plastic wrap and set in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Let all three dough balls chill for about 60-90 minutes.</li>

          </ol>
          <h3>Make the Loaf:</h3>
          <ol>

            <li>Remove all three dough balls from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Weigh the white ball of dough and divide into 7 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the light and dark chocolate dough balls.</li>
            <li>You should now have 21 pieces of dough.</li>
            <li>Start by rolling each of the light brown pieces into a small hot dog shape.</li>
            <li>Then using a rolling pin roll each of the dark chocolate hunks into flat oval.</li>
            <li>Place the light chocolate sausage onto the flat dark chocolate oval.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry brush lightly coat the edges of the dark chocolate with milk.</li>
            <li>Then fold the dark chocolate over the light chocolate as if you were wrapping a hot dog bun around a hot dog.</li>
            <li>The result should look like a chocolate cigar.</li>
            <li>Now take the white dough and toll into an oval with the rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process by placing the dark chocolate wrapped ‘sausage’ onto the white dough oval.</li>
            <li>Paint the edges of the white dough with milk and then fold it over the dark chocolate, closing the seems.</li>
            <li>The result should now look like a log with a light chocolate center, a wrapping of dark chocolate, and then a final wrapping of white dough.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process with the remaining dough until you have 7 logs.</li>
            <li>Now, roll each log lengthwise with your hands, until it becomes doubled in length. Like a long snake.</li>
            <li>Slice in half.</li>
            <li>You should now have 14 skinny logs.</li>

          </ol>
          <h3>Bake the Loaf:</h3>
          <ol>

            <li>Prepare loaf pan with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Stack dough logs into the pan.</li>
            <li>Cover with a light tea towel and place in a draft free warm location to puff and double in size. At least an hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C).</li>
            <li>Then turn down to 350 F (176 C) and place loaf into the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35-45 minutes or until inner temperature reaches 190 F.</li>
            <li>Place pan on a cooling rack for 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove loaf from pan.</li>
            <li>Let bread cool another 10 minutes.</li>
